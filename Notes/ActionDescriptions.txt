Auto Align To Branch:
Uses the “Branch” state chosen from the ReefBox to on-the-fly pathfind to the scoring position for that branch
Raises elevator to “LevelState” decided by the operator
Auto Fire triggers when the robot sees a branch close enough to score on, which then outtakes the coral onto the branch
Elevator is homed

Auto Align to Barge:
Drives to barge scoring position using a set Y, and the robot’s current X (if X is greater than what would be able to score, a default X is used). If the robot’s current Y is in the opposing alliance’s side, the set Y will flip to drive to the barge from the opposing alliance’s side
Raises elevator to barge position
When elevator reaches barge position, run manipulator wheels outwards to fire
